# German_Apartment_Rental
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project 1

# Motivation
I found this [record](https://www.kaggle.com/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany) from Corrie Bartelheimer on kaggle and I am really curious what information I can find out.

# Datasets
Later I asked Immoscout24 for an API access to download additional data. Instead an API access
they provided a complete dataset of germen housing prices over the last 15 years.
This dataset is used for the analysis.

# Collaboration
Therefore it is a Udacity project, there is no collaboration needed.
